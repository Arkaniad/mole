// Package queue is the lead queue: dispatch, leases, and recovery.
//
// Leads are LEASED rather than marked running (§9.4). The difference only shows
// up when something goes wrong, which is when it matters: a worker that dies
// mid-lead leaves a `running` row nothing will ever revisit, and rev 1 had no
// way out of that. A lease expires, and an expired lease is a lead the next
// sweep puts back.
//
// The single property everything else rests on: a lead is dispatched to at most
// one worker. Two workers running the same lead pay for it twice, and the
// ledger cannot detect that — both charges are real, both are correctly
// recorded, and the budget simply drains faster than the work justifies.
