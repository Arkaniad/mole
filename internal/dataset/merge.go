//
// §15 calls this "the hardest quality problem in this document", and the reason
// is that every other stage has a right answer available to it. A schema either
// validates or does not. A row either quotes its source or does not. Whether two
// rows are the same company is a judgement, and no amount of care in the code
// turns a judgement into a fact.
//
// So the response is not to be clever, it is to be measurable. merge_test.go
// builds datasets whose duplicate structure is KNOWN — the same entity written
// several ways, plus entities that genuinely differ — and reports pairwise
// precision and recall. Those numbers are in `mole eval`. They are the only
// quality figure in M9 that needs no model and no labelling, which is exactly
// why the thresholds below are calibrated against them rather than chosen.
//
// # Three deliberate choices
//
// Blocking, because comparing every pair is quadratic and a result set reaches
// thousands of rows. Multi-pass blocking, because a single block key loses true
// matches at its edges.
//
// Complete linkage, not transitive closure. If A matches B and B matches C, a
// union-find would put all three together even when A and C are plainly
// different — "Acme Ltd", "Acme", "Acme Foods" chains a real company into an
// unrelated one. A row joins a cluster only if it matches EVERY member.
//
// Conflicts preserved, never resolved. §11 renders contradiction edges
// explicitly "rather than silently resolved by whichever claim the model liked",
// and two sources giving one company two revenues is that problem with a column
// header. The merge records both.

// Options tune the merge.
