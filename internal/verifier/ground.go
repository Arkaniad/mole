// Budgeted re-fetch grounding (§11.5.2).
//
// §11.5 names consistency checking's blind spot: it cannot catch a
// hallucinated-but-self-consistent claim, which is the dominant failure mode. Two
// mechanisms answer that. The first, a verbatim quote checked at the actor boundary,
// has been in place since M1. This is the second.
//
// It is the ONLY path by which source text re-enters the pipeline, and that makes
// two properties load-bearing rather than tidy:
//
//   - The text enters a verifier context and is discarded when this function
//     returns. It is never written to the store, never returned to the caller, and
//     never reaches the planner digest — which has no field for it, so §9.1's rule
//     holds structurally rather than by discipline.
//   - It is bounded twice, by a spend allowance and by a check count. An unbounded
//     re-fetch loop is free in token mode (§8.5's hole) and the most expensive thing
//     in the session in USD mode.
//
// Why "in context" matters more than "present". A quote can appear verbatim and
// still not support the claim: the sentence before it may read "it is often
// claimed that", or the claim may generalize a result the quote scopes narrowly.
// That is quote-mining, it survives mechanism 1 completely, and it is what this
// spends a model call on.

// GroundOutcome is what one check learned.
