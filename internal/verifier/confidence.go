// Derived confidence (§11.3).
//
// Rev 1 asked the model for a confidence number. §11.3 rejects that: self-reported
// confidence is uncalibrated and mostly encodes fluency, and M4 slice 0 measured
// the consequence — a fluent claim from one anonymous page outranked a claim three
// publishers agreed on. So confidence is computed from graph structure instead:
// deterministic, reproducible, and explainable line by line in a trace.
//
// §11.3 names five inputs. Four are implemented:
//
//	independent corroborating publishers   — Score.Publishers
//	source class weight                    — Score.Class
//	presence and weight of contradictions  — Score.Contradictors
//	grounding result                       — Score.Grounded
//
// The fifth, "recency vs. the question's volatility", is deliberately absent. It
// needs to know how fast the answer to THIS question changes, and nothing here can
// measure that — a fixed half-life would be a number invented to look rigorous.
// §14.2's corpus is what would supply it. Confidence is honest about being a
// four-term score rather than pretending to a fifth.

// SourceClass is how much weight a publisher's output carries on its own.
