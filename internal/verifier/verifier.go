// reasoning first and emits content only afterwards, so a ceiling sized for the JSON
// produces empty content with finish_reason "length" (llm.ErrEmptyOutput).
//
// Measured, exactly: gemma4:12b judging four pairs reported "1980 completion tokens
// produced no content", and 1980 was precisely 1500 + 4*120. Half the batches in a
// re-judge run returned nothing at all.
//
// Reasoning cost is per CALL, not per pair, so the base carries it and the per-pair
// term only covers the verdicts. That also means a smaller batch does not divide the
// overhead — it pays it again — which is worth knowing before turning
// llm.verifier-batch-size down to escape a timeout.

// pairs printed nothing about the seven, and the ceiling that caused it was
// indistinguishable from a model that simply had no opinion.
//
// Both readings lead somewhere different. Guessing between them is how

// are logged rather than inferred: stop_reason "length" with output_tokens at the
// ceiling is truncation, and anything else is the model.
