// Package academic is the provider boundary for scholarly sources (§10.2).
//
// arXiv and PubMed/PMC are the keyless defaults; Unpaywall turns a DOI into a
// legal open-access copy.
//
// §10.2 calls Unpaywall "the single highest-leverage call in the package", and
// measurement does not bear that out for how mole uses it. Over a 97-paper sweep
// of the contradiction corpus, 46 papers carried no DOI at all, and of the 28
// unreadable ones that did, Unpaywall placed none — leaving it worth about 5%.
// The binding constraint on academic coverage is missing identifiers, not
// unresolved ones. It is kept because that 5% is real and because a DOI is what
// the other providers hand around; the claim about leverage is not. Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex are deliberately absent — they
// serve citation-graph queries, which is a different capability from finding
// papers about a question. So is ScienceDirect/Elsevier, for a harder reason:
// full text there needs an institutional entitlement the API does not grant.
//
// The API surface is the easy part. §10.3 is the milestone: every provider is
// rate-limited and identifies itself, because a worker pool without that gets
// the user banned in week one. Both are enforced here rather than left to each
// implementation, so a new provider cannot forget.
