// Package executor runs a research session: plan, dispatch, settle, replan.
//
// This is §9.2's loop. One worker for now — M5 turns on a pool.
//
// What is already safe, audited rather than assumed (M5 slice 3): leases stop
// double dispatch; reserve-before-dispatch bounds the money, and the lead
// counter is applied inside that same transaction so MaxLeads binds too;
// WebActor assigns to no receiver field, so one actor serves many concurrent
// leads; the rate limiter, the robots cache, the artifact cache, the estimator
// and the pricing table all carry their own locks; Planner and Verifier hold
// configuration only; planner.Digest is now mutex-guarded.
//
// What is NOT yet safe, and has to be handled when the pool lands rather than
// discovered then — both are loop-locals today, so nothing can race them until
// a worker touches them:
//
//   - leadQuestion, the map from lead to sub-question, is written at plan time
//     and read per lead.
//   - Result, whose LeadsRun/LeadsCached/LeadsFailed counters and Claims slice
//     are appended to from the loop body.
//
// Digest's exported FIELDS are also unguarded on purpose: BudgetRemaining and
// Contradictions are written between batches, by the coordinator, which is
// where they belong — both are current state read fresh for a planner call,
// not something a lead produces.
//
// The invariant that matters most is unglamorous: every reservation is resolved
// on every path. A settle that is skipped because a lead failed leaves budget
// held forever — neither spent nor available — and the session runs out of
// money it never used. Failure paths outnumber the success path here, which is
// why the settle is arranged so it cannot be missed rather than repeated at
// each exit.
