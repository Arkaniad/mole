// Error policy (§9.5).
//
// actor.Run fails routinely, and the useful question is never "did it fail" but
// "does failing again help". Three answers:
//
//   - Transient — the same request might work shortly. Retry, then give up.
//   - Degraded — this lead is not going to produce anything, but the session is
//     fine. Record why and move on.
//   - Fatal — nothing will work. Stop, and spend the escrow on a partial report
//     rather than continuing to burn budget on calls that cannot succeed.
//
// Partial cost is settled in every case. The tokens were spent whether or not
// the call succeeded, and a ledger of successes cannot enforce a ceiling.

// Class is what to do about an error.
