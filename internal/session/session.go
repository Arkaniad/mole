//
// It exists because two callers need that sequence and only one of them has a
// terminal. `mole research` had all of it inline, interleaved with flag handling
// and fmt.Printf, which made the daemon's options "duplicate 240 lines" or
// "import a CLI". Nothing here prints, opens a database, reads config, or knows
// what a flag is — callers inject what they built and receive what happened.
//
// The split into Recover / Create / Run is not cosmetic. Recovery is per
// PROCESS, so a daemon sweeps once at boot rather than once per session. And a
// daemon must return a session id to its caller before the work finishes, so
// creating the row and running the loop cannot be one call.
