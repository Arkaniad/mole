// §4's last unbuilt column: "stable across 3 holdout windows".
//
// §4's row asks for n, effect size, significance AND stability. The first three
// were computed and enforced from M8; the fourth was named in the known gaps as
// needing "three more queries per hypothesis and a splitting rule nobody has
// chosen". It needs one more query, and the splitting rule is below.
//
// # Why stability rather than more p-values
//
// A significant result on one sample is one draw. The failure it does not catch is
// the one this tool is most exposed to: a difference driven by a subset — one
// month, one region's worth of rows, one batch of imports — reported as a property
// of the data. Re-testing on disjoint subsets catches exactly that, and no amount
// of care with alpha does.
//
// # The rule, and what it is not
//
// A difference is STABLE when it points the same way in every window that had
// enough data to test. Direction, not significance: a third of the rows has a
// third of the power, so requiring each window to clear alpha would mark almost
// every real effect unstable and would be a statement about sample size dressed
// as one about the data. The count of windows that were individually significant
// is reported beside it for a reader who wants the stronger signal.
//
// The per-window tests are NOT Holm-corrected against each other. They are the
// same hypothesis re-examined on disjoint data rather than three new hypotheses,
// and correcting them would answer a question nobody asked — see Pairwise for the
// case where correction is right.

// HoldoutWindows is how many disjoint subsets a comparison is re-tested on.
//
// Three, because §4 says three. It is also the smallest number for which
// "consistent across windows" says anything: two windows agreeing is a coin
// landing the same way twice.
