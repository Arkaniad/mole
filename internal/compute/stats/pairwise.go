// Comparing more than two groups (§4, and the k-group gap M8 named).
//
// The gate compared the two largest buckets and nothing else, with the argument
// written into the code: "comparing every pair of k buckets is k(k−1)/2 tests
// against the same alpha, which manufactures a significant result out of noise".
// That argument is right about the danger and wrong about the remedy. Ten groups
// at alpha = 0.05 give a 90% chance of at least one spurious "significant" —
// which is exactly why multiple-comparison corrections exist, and why refusing to
// look at eight of ten groups is not the only alternative.
//
// So: every pair is tested, and every p is adjusted by Holm–Bonferroni before any
// verdict is derived from it. Holm rather than plain Bonferroni because it is
// uniformly more powerful at the same family-wise error rate — it is not an
// approximation of Bonferroni, it dominates it — and rather than
// Benjamini–Hochberg because BH controls the false-discovery RATE, which is the
// right target when a hundred hypotheses are being screened and the wrong one
// when a research tool is about to state a difference as a finding. A user reading
// "spend differs between north and south" wants the probability that ANY of the
// stated differences is spurious to be small.
//
// The unadjusted p is kept beside the adjusted one, because a reader who knows
// statistics will want to see both and one who does not should see the number the
// verdict was actually derived from.

// MaxGroups bounds how many buckets are compared pairwise.
//
// Six groups is fifteen comparisons, at which point Holm's threshold for the
// smallest p is alpha/15 = 0.0033 and a genuine moderate effect stops being
// detectable — the correction has eaten the power the extra groups were supposed
// to buy. Past this the largest groups are compared and the envelope says how many
// were left out, which is the honest version of the old behaviour rather than a
// silent one.

// support a test (fewer than two records, no resolvable spread) are skipped, and
// the count of comparisons for the correction is the number actually RUN rather
// than the number of pairs that exist: correcting for tests that never happened
