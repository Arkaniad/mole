// Running code inside the sandbox (§3.6).
//
// This is the half of §3.6 that executes rather than reports. It runs one
// container with the flags Limits.Flags renders, feeds it a script on stdin,
// and returns what the script printed — bounded in size, bounded in time, and
// with no route out except stdout.
//
// # What the caller is trusting
//
// Not the script. The script is model-authored code over real data, which is
// the entire reason for the container. What the caller trusts is that the
// runtime applies the flags, and slice 6's container test is what establishes
// that: no network, read-only rootfs, no capabilities, non-root uid, noexec
// scratch.
//
// # What crosses out
//
// stdout, capped. That is a channel and it is the caller's job to constrain what
// may travel down it — see internal/compute/coderunner, which accepts only
// declared names with numeric values. This package deliberately does not
// interpret the bytes: mixing "run it safely" with "decide what may leave" in
// one place is how one of them ends up implicit.
