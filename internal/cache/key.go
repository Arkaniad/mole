// Package cache stops a session paying twice for the same artifact (§9.3).
//
// Rev 1 did `if cache.SeenRecently(lead) { continue }`, which had two problems.
// The planner asked for something and got nothing back, so the next replan
// spawned an equivalent lead and the loop livelocked. And keying at the LEAD
// level missed the common case: two differently-worded queries surfacing the
// same page still paid for two fetches.
//
// Both fixes follow from keying on the ARTIFACT — a normalized URL, a DOI, a
// query hash — and from returning the stored result rather than skipping. A hit
// is an answer, not an absence.
