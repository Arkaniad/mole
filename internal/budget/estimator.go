// per (actor type, depth), seeded with conservative constants on a cold start.
//
// p75 rather than the mean because the reservation should usually cover the
// call. A bad estimate costs accuracy, not correctness — the reservation
// mechanism means an under-estimate shows up as a flagged overshoot in
// SettleResult, never as a budget breach.

// from a cheap tier to an expensive one gets reservations sized for the old one
// until the window turns over. That is an accuracy cost rather than a correctness
// one — an under-reservation surfaces as a flagged overshoot in SettleResult,
// never as a budget breach — and it is the same property the rolling window has
