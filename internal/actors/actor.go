// Package actors executes leads.
//
// An Actor is the only component that touches raw source material. It takes one
// lead, does the work, and returns a summary plus claims — never the pages,
// never the raw text. That boundary is what keeps planner cost from compounding
// as research deepens (§2), and it is also where fabricated citations die
// (§11.5).
