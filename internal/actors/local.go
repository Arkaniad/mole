// return summary plus claims plus costs — and the evidence is different in one
// way that decides the whole implementation: it never leaves the machine.
//
// The run is four steps, and the model is only in the first and the last:
//
//	profile  →  the model picks a template and columns   (§12.3: it cannot author SQL)
//	         →  hypothesis.Render turns that into SQL     (identifiers from the profile)
//	         →  sqlguard + the aggregation gate run it    (§12.2, §12.1)
//	         →  the model mines claims from the envelope  (§11.5 quote check, unchanged)
//
// The middle two steps are deterministic. What the model influences is which
// question gets asked; what it never touches is the data, the statement, or
// whether the answer may cross.
