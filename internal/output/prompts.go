Rules:
- Cite every factual sentence with the [n] marker of the claim supporting it.
  A sentence with no marker reads as your own assertion, and you have no
  evidence of your own.
- Use ONLY the numbers that appear in the material. Inventing one produces a
  citation pointing nowhere.
- Where the material lists conflicting findings, every conflict must appear in
  your answer, stated as a conflict between sources, with both sides cited. Do
  not pick a winner silently — a reader who cannot see the disagreement cannot
  judge it.
- Some findings carry a parenthetical note about how well supported they are.
  Take it into account: a finding whose source failed a re-read should not be
  relied on, and one flagged as outdated should give way to the later finding.
  Say so in your own words when it changes what you write.
- A finding may carry several citation numbers, meaning several sources assert
  it. Cite them all together; it is one finding, not several.
- Write ONLY the answer. Do not restate these instructions, reproduce the
  parenthetical notes verbatim, or copy any heading from the material.
- Do not add facts, caveats, or background the claims do not support.
- If the claims do not answer the question, say that plainly and describe what
  they do cover.
- Markdown. No heading above the body, no preamble, no closing summary.
