// Duplicate collapse and disagreement disclosure (§11.2, §11.3).
//
// §11.2's rule: a duplicate_of cluster renders as ONE claim with N sources. Two
// things follow, and both were visibly wrong in the last live run.
//
// The report stops restating itself. That run produced
//
//	[1] MambaByte compares favorably to various subword baselines
//	[1] Compared to existing subword models, MambaByte is competitive
//
// as two separate bullets from one source — the same finding twice, which reads as
// two independent facts and is neither.
//
// And corroboration becomes visible. Three publishers agreeing is the strongest
// signal §11.3 has, and rendering them as three bullets hides it behind repetition
// rather than showing it as one claim with three citations.

// Finding is one assertion put in front of the synthesis model.
//
// A collapsed cluster, so Sources may hold several. Contradicts names the findings
// that dispute it — surfaced rather than resolved, because a reader who cannot see a
// disagreement cannot judge it, and §11.3's lowered confidence is a number the prose
// never shows.
