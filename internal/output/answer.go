// DefaultAskClaims bounds how many claims reach an ask prompt.
//
// Smaller than a report's, deliberately. A report is the whole session's answer
// and is paid for from escrow set aside for exactly that; an ask is a follow-up
// question against a session whose budget is mostly spent, and its whole promise
// (§13) is that it is cheap. Retrieval is doing the work of choosing, so a
// tighter cap costs relevance only when retrieval was wrong anyway.

// Answer responds to a NEW question from an existing session's claim graph (§13).
//
// Retrieval-only: no search, no fetch, no new claims. The claim graph is already
// paid for, and this asks what it says about something the original question did
// not cover — which is what makes the daemon's persistence worth something. A
// coding agent whose own context was compacted can re-interrogate a finished
// session for one model call instead of researching it again from nothing.
//
// The caller owns the reservation. Like Generate, this makes the model call and
// reports its cost; reserving and settling belong to whoever knows the ledger.
// Passing a nil LLM produces the evidence listing with no call at all, which is
// the honest response when nothing can be afforded.
