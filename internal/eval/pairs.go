// Adjudicator test sets.
//
// §11.2's edge inference is the stage whose errors are hardest to see: a bad extractor
// produces no claims, a bad judge produces a confident graph of wrong edges and everything
// downstream reads it as fact. A live run produced 16 contradictions out of 37 edges, and
// the model's own rationales described the pairs as being about different topics — which
// is "unrelated". Every false positive spent a follow-up lead, docked two claims'
// confidence, and put a disagreement in the report that was not there.
//
// None of the existing metrics can see that. "disagreement rate" counts what was FOUND and
// says so in its own comment; measuring what is CORRECT needs someone to say what the right
// answer was.
//
// So: dump the pairs a session judged, with both claim texts, for a person to label. After
// that, any prompt or model change is measurable in seconds, offline, against real pairs a
// real run produced — rather than against questions someone invented to be measured.
