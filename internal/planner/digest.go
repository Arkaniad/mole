// Package planner decides what to research next.
//
// §9.1's problem: rev 1 passed every summary to the planner on every replan.
// Summaries accumulate, so planner input grew with lead count and total planner
// cost was quadratic in leads — worst precisely when research goes deep, which
// is the case the whole design exists to serve.
//
// The fix is the Digest: a fixed-size structured state that is updated
// incrementally and compacted when it exceeds its budget, so planner input is
// O(1) in lead count no matter how long a session runs.
//
// Two properties of this implementation are worth stating up front.
//
// The digest is maintained and compacted MECHANICALLY — no model call. Paying a
// model to compact the structure that exists to control model cost is
// self-defeating, and compaction is a policy question ("what does the planner
// stop needing?") that has a defensible answer in code: answered questions
// first, then old dead ends.
//
// It also carries no page-derived text. Sub-question wording is the planner's
// own prior output, dead-end causes are a fixed enum, and everything else is a
// count. So untrusted content never reaches the planner at all, which is
// stronger than fencing it (§3.2) — there is nothing to fence. The cost is
// real and stated in Replan: the planner reasons about coverage, not findings.

//
//  1. Dead ends beyond the worst few. They are already collapsed by cause, so
//     what is left is a long tail of one-offs.
//  2. Sub-question text, truncated. Losing the tail of a question is worse
//     than losing the question, so this comes before losing any.
//  3. Open questions, most-attempted first, with a count of what was elided.
//
// Answered questions are deliberately NOT dropped. An earlier version dropped
// them first, which looked like the gentlest step and was in fact a no-op:
// String() serializes only OPEN questions, so removing an answered one cannot
// reduce the serialized size. The loop therefore emptied the entire answered set
// on every compaction without getting under the limit, then moved on to the
// steps that actually work. They cost memory, bounded by MaxLeads, and nothing
// else.
//
// Step 3 is a genuine loss and is last for that reason: a planner that cannot
// see an open question may re-plan it, paying twice. It exists because the
// alternative is worse. Without it a session where nothing gets answered grows
// the digest without limit — measured at 43k characters over 500 open
// questions, ten times the budget — which is exactly the quadratic planner cost
// §9.1 forbids, arriving by a route the first version of this function missed.
