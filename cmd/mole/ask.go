// mole ask
//
// research.ask (§13) from a terminal. The same operation an agent gets over
// MCP: read a finished session's claim graph, retrieve the claims relevant to a
// new question, and answer from them with citations. No search, no fetch, no new
// claims — the evidence was gathered and paid for by the original run, and this
// is what makes that run worth keeping.
//
// It shares mcpserver.Deps.Ask rather than reimplementing it. The budgeting
// there is subtle enough (an ask cannot be charged to a settled session, so it
// opens a tiny one of its own) that a second copy would be a second set of §8
// bugs.
//
// It writes, and it does so while a daemon may be running. That is safe, and
// openDBNoMigrate explains exactly why: SQLite serialises writers per
// transaction, not per connection, and an ask's transactions are short. What it
// must not do — and does not — is migrate.
